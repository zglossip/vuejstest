# VueJS Test

A test app for me to learn how to use Vue, VueX, and other Vue technologies.

The app itself will serve as a database for Pokémon, with exact usage to be defined later. Nothing here is really intended to be taken seriously. This may grow into something, but probably not.

Data for Pokémon come from:
* https://pokeapi.co/
* https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json

To run:
* `npm run start` to host dev build on https://localhost:3000/
* `npm run build` to build prod build in /dist folder
* `npm run lint` to run ESLint against code
* `npm run lint:fix` to run ESLint and automatically fix code
